# ClosedLoopControlBlocks

This library consist of different blocks that are built to enable the simulation of a closed block system.
The blocks made with multithreading in mind and to ease that it contains a helping class called "".
This calss is used to time the calculations, so that the blocks stay in the same time frame.

There is an example of a line chart with all blocks over here: https://plot.ly/~redimo/1.embed
